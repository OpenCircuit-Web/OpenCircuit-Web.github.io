    <h2>What is OpenCircuit Conference?</h2>
    <p>
        This website is a template that you could use for a (small) academic conference. 
        It&rsquo;s got a page for registration, where you can embed a Google Form or some other way for participants to register.
        It&rsquo;s got a program page to list the schedule for the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a directions page to add a bunch of instructions how to get to the conference.
        It&rsquo;s got a page to put up the flyers and other promotional materials for folks to download.

        This template was created from a website I made for 
        <a target="_blank" href="http://math.ucr.edu/~mathconn/">MathConnections 2019</a>,
        in case you want to see an example of this template being used in the wild.

    <h2>What does OpenCircuit Need?</h2>
    </p>
    OpenCircuit invites submissions in various formats that may diverge from traditional academic publications:

    - Preliminary or in-progress research snapshots demonstrating novel ideas or methodologies
    - Experience reports on the challenges and successes of building or deploying open-source accelerators, including insights into the tools and processes involved
    - Thought-provoking essays and surveys either supporting or critiquing methodologies, practices, or general approaches within the field of open-source reconfigurable computing
    - Reflective retrospectives on past projects, tools, languages, and techniques that have influenced the landscape of accelerator design
    - Calls to action or discussions on unresolved challenges in the domain, inviting innovative solutions or collaborations
    - Demonstrations of operational systems or prototypes, which participants can present in live demos during the workshop
    </p>

    <h2>Organizers</h2>
    <p>
        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
